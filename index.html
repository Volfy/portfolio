                <p>
                    I'm a web developer using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
                    <!-- Is this line necessary? -->
                    You can see some of my work<span class="wpos-large"> to the right</span><span class="wpos-small" hidden> below</span>.
                    There are more projects available on my <a href="">GitHub</a> account too.
                    <!-- Potentially link to my music -->
                    I'm also a music producer, which I studied at BIMM Institute. Here's my <a href="">resume</a>.
                    <!-- is this line necessary? -->
                    Occasionally, I dabble in Max/MSP too.

                    My interests lie in art, science & technology.
                    Particularly I like trying out Generative AIs, learning about Biotechnology (+ brewing my own meads), and finding interesting new music.

The menu is populated using JS Objects so that new entries can be added and removed easily. I've learnt that Webpack and npm scripts make life a bit easier. I also tried out using Bulma.css for the style - I was curious what using a CSS framework could be like.</p>
